# Tic-Tac-Toe

## About this project

This is the first project I did using React. I followed the tutorial made by React. You can see the tutorial on their [website](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-for-the-tutorial).

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/stefanreusens/Tic-Tac-Toe
    $ cd Chat-app/
    $ npm install
    $ npm start
